# Divide Two Integers

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers  **without**  using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `8.345` would be truncated to `8`, and `-2.7335` would be truncated to `-2`.

Return  *the  **quotient**  after dividing* `dividend` *by* `divisor`.

 **Note:** Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the  **32-bit**  signed integer range: `[−231, 231 − 1]`. For this problem, if the quotient is  **strictly greater than**  `231 - 1`, then return `231 - 1`, and if the quotient is  **strictly less than**  `-231`, then return `-231`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 10/3 = 3.33333.. which is truncated to 3.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
Explanation: 7/-3 = -2.33333.. which is truncated to -2.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- -231 <= dividend, divisor <= 231 - 1
- divisor != 0

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        // Handle overflow case
        if (dividend == INT_MIN && divisor == -1) return INT_MAX;
        if (dividend == INT_MIN && divisor == 1) return INT_MIN;

        // Use long long to avoid overflow during abs
        long long a = abs((long long)dividend);
        long long b = abs((long long)divisor);
        long long result = 0;

        while (a >= b) {
            long long temp = b, multiple = 1;
            while (a >= (temp << 1)) {
                temp <<= 1;
                multiple <<= 1;
            }
            a -= temp;
            result += multiple;
        }

        // Apply sign
        if ((dividend < 0) ^ (divisor < 0)) result = -result;

        return (int)result;
    }
};

```
